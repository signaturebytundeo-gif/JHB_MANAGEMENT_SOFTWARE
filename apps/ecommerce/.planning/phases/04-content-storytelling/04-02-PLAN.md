<objective>
Build the Our Story page at /our-story with cinematic scroll-driven layout, Chef Anthony's origin story, the sauce story, team bios (3 members), restaurant locations (3 South Florida), and a Shop CTA at the bottom.

Purpose: The Story page builds brand trust and emotional connection. It answers "Who makes this?" and "Why should I buy?" — both essential for converting visitors to customers.
Output: 1 page route + 5 components + CSS scroll animation additions
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Install react-intersection-observer and create Story page components</name>

**Install dependency:**
```bash
npm install react-intersection-observer
```

**Create src/components/story/StoryHero.tsx** (Server Component):
- Full-viewport hero section (min-h-screen) with dark overlay on background image
- Use Next.js Image with `fill` and `preload={true}` for LCP optimization
- Display hero title in large white text (text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold) and subtitle in gray-300
- Background: gradient overlay from brand-dark to transparent over the image
- Use the dark theme colors: bg-brand-dark background, text-white, text-brand-gold for accents

**Create src/components/story/ScrollSection.tsx** (Client Component — 'use client'):
- Uses react-intersection-observer `useInView` hook with threshold: 0.3, triggerOnce: true
- Props: title (string), content (string), image (string), imageAlt (string), layout ('text-left' | 'text-right' | 'centered')
- When inView: opacity-100 translate-y-0; when not: opacity-0 translate-y-10
- Transition: transition-all duration-1000 ease-out
- For 'text-left' layout: text on left, image on right (flex row on md+, column on mobile)
- For 'text-right' layout: image on left, text on right
- For 'centered' layout: full-width text centered above image
- Section takes min-h-[80vh] with py-24 px-4 md:px-8, max-w-6xl mx-auto
- Title: text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-brand-gold mb-6
- Content: text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed
- Image: Next.js Image component with rounded-lg, width/height appropriate, sizes prop

**Create src/components/story/TeamSection.tsx** (Client Component — 'use client' for scroll reveal):
- Wraps team member cards in a grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8)
- Each card: team member image (circular, w-48 h-48 rounded-full mx-auto), name (text-2xl font-bold text-white), role (text-brand-gold), bio (text-gray-300)
- Uses useInView for staggered reveal: each card gets a delay (index * 200ms via inline style transition-delay)
- Section heading "Meet the Team" in text-4xl font-bold text-brand-gold text-center mb-12
- Import team data from @/data/team

**Create src/components/story/RestaurantLocations.tsx** (Client Component — 'use client' for scroll reveal):
- Grid of 3 location cards (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8)
- Each card: restaurant name (text-xl font-bold text-white), full address (text-gray-300), phone number
- Card styling: bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-lg p-6
- Section heading "Visit Our Restaurants" in text-4xl font-bold text-brand-gold text-center mb-12
- Scroll reveal with useInView, triggerOnce: true
- Import restaurants data from @/data/restaurants

**Create src/components/story/StoryCTA.tsx** (Server Component):
- Full-width section with centered content on a subtle gradient or brand-dark background
- Heading: "Ready to Taste the Authentic Flavor?" in text-4xl font-bold text-white text-center
- Subtext: "Bring Chef Anthony's restaurant recipes to your kitchen" in text-xl text-gray-300
- Button: Link to /shop, styled as bg-brand-gold text-brand-dark font-bold py-4 px-8 rounded-lg text-lg hover:bg-brand-gold-light transition-colors inline-block
- Button text: "Shop Our Sauces"
- Section padding: py-24 px-4

**Update src/app/globals.css** — Add CSS scroll-driven animation keyframes with @supports progressive enhancement:
```css
@supports (animation-timeline: view()) {
  .story-scroll-reveal {
    animation: story-fade-in-up linear both;
    animation-timeline: view();
    animation-range: entry 25% entry 75%;
  }

  @keyframes story-fade-in-up {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(50px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
  }
}
```
This is progressive enhancement — the react-intersection-observer in ScrollSection handles the primary animation. The CSS adds native scroll-driven polish where supported.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors. Verify react-intersection-observer is in package.json dependencies. Check that ScrollSection.tsx, TeamSection.tsx, and RestaurantLocations.tsx contain 'use client' directive. Verify StoryCTA.tsx contains Link to /shop.
  </verify>
  <done>
5 story components created. ScrollSection, TeamSection, RestaurantLocations are Client Components with scroll-reveal animations. StoryHero uses preload for LCP. StoryCTA links to /shop. CSS scroll-driven animations added as progressive enhancement.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Our Story page route with metadata and compose all sections</name>
  <files>
    src/app/our-story/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Create src/app/our-story/page.tsx** as a Server Component:

Import all story components and data:
- StoryHero from @/components/story/StoryHero
- ScrollSection from @/components/story/ScrollSection
- TeamSection from @/components/story/TeamSection
- RestaurantLocations from @/components/story/RestaurantLocations
- StoryCTA from @/components/story/StoryCTA
- storyContent from @/data/story-content
- team from @/data/team
- restaurants from @/data/restaurants

**Export metadata** (Next.js Metadata type):
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Our Story - Jamaica House Brand',
  description: "From age 11 in Jamaica to three South Florida restaurants — discover how Chef Anthony's 30-year journey led to Jamaica House Brand's authentic jerk sauce.",
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Our Story - Jamaica House Brand',
    description: "Chef Anthony's journey from Jamaica to your table.",
    images: ['/images/story/hero.jpg'],
  },
}
```

**Page composition** (top to bottom):
1. `<StoryHero>` — Full-screen hero with title/subtitle from storyContent.hero
2. First `<ScrollSection>` — Chef Anthony's origin story (storyContent.sections[0]), layout="text-left"
3. Second `<ScrollSection>` — The sauce story (storyContent.sections[1]), layout="text-right"
4. `<TeamSection>` — Passes team array
5. `<RestaurantLocations>` — Passes restaurants array
6. `<StoryCTA>` — Shop CTA at bottom

Wrap everything in `<main className="bg-brand-dark">`. Each section should have consistent spacing. The page stays as a Server Component — interactivity is encapsulated in child Client Components.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — page builds without errors. Navigate to /our-story in dev server — page renders with all sections. Verify: hero section visible, two story sections present, team section shows 3 members, restaurants shows 3 locations, CTA button links to /shop.
  </verify>
  <done>
/our-story page renders as Server Component composing StoryHero, two ScrollSections (Chef Anthony origin + sauce story), TeamSection (3 bios), RestaurantLocations (3 South FL locations), and StoryCTA linking to /shop. SEO metadata configured.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>
