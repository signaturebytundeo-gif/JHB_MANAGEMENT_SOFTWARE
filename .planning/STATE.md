## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Production tracking as first module - everything flows from knowing what was produced and where it is
- Build all 10 modules (full vision) - founders want complete system for investor conversations
- CSV import before API integration - pragmatic bridge to get data flowing immediately
- MMDDYY batch code format - matches existing manual workflow Anthony uses
- Founders-only initial users - Anthony and Tunde first, expand to team once workflows proven
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss - Latest version with improved performance and CSS-native theming
- Use shadcn/ui component library - Customizable, accessible, TypeScript-first components for faster development
