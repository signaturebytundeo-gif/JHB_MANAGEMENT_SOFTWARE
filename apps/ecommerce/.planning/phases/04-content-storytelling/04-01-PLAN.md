<objective>
Create the TypeScript data layer for Phase 4: content interfaces, recipe data (6 recipes referencing products), story content (Chef Anthony's origin, sauce story), team bios, restaurant locations, and a schema.org Recipe JSON-LD generator.

Purpose: All Phase 4 pages (Our Story, Recipes) depend on this typed data layer. Building it first ensures consistent content modeling and enables parallel page development.
Output: 7 files — 2 type definitions, 4 data files, 1 SEO utility

**Create src/types/recipe.ts** with these interfaces:
- `Recipe`: id, slug, title, description, image (string), images (string[]), prepTime (number, minutes), cookTime (number, minutes), servings (number), difficulty ('easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'), ingredients (Ingredient[]), instructions (Instruction[]), featuredProducts (string[] — product IDs from products.ts), tags (string[])
- `Ingredient`: item (string), amount (string), notes? (string)
- `Instruction`: step (number), text (string), image? (string)

**Create src/types/story.ts** with these interfaces:
- `StorySection`: id (string), title (string), content (string), image (string), imageAlt (string), layout ('text-left' | 'text-right' | 'centered')
- `TeamMember`: id (string), name (string), role (string), bio (string), image (string)
- `Restaurant`: id (string), name (string), address (string), city (string), state (string), zip (string), phone (string), image (string)

**Create src/data/story-content.ts** exporting `storyContent` object with:
- `hero`: title ("Our Story"), subtitle ("From a family kitchen to three restaurants — and now, your table"), image path placeholder (/images/story/hero.jpg)
- `sections`: array of 2 StorySection objects:
  1. **Chef Anthony's Origin** (STORY-02): "A Chef Born at 11 Years Old" — Chef Anthony discovered his passion for cooking at age 11 in Jamaica. He brought those flavors to South Florida, where he built not one but three thriving restaurants. Each dish honors traditional recipes passed down through generations.
  2. **The Sauce Story** (STORY-03): "The Sauce Everyone Asked For" — For years, 92% of Jamaica House restaurant guests asked the same question: 'Can I buy a bottle of that sauce?' After countless requests, Chef Anthony decided to bottle the exact recipe used in his restaurants. Jamaica House Brand brings the authentic restaurant experience to your home kitchen.

**Create src/data/team.ts** exporting `team` array of 3 TeamMember objects (STORY-04):
1. Chef Anthony — Founder & Head Chef, bio about his journey from Jamaica to South Florida, building 3 restaurants, image: /images/team/chef-anthony.jpg
2. Tunde — Co-Founder & Operations, bio about scaling the brand from restaurant to retail, image: /images/team/tunde.jpg
3. Tomi — Co-Founder & Brand Strategy, bio about bringing the authentic taste to a wider audience, image: /images/team/tomi.jpg

**Create src/data/restaurants.ts** exporting `restaurants` array of 3 Restaurant objects (STORY-05):
1. Jamaica House — Lauderhill, FL (use realistic South Florida address placeholder, e.g., 1234 NW 56th Ave, Lauderhill, FL 33313)
2. Jamaica House — Miramar, FL (e.g., 2345 Miramar Pkwy, Miramar, FL 33025)
3. Jamaica House — Pembroke Pines, FL (e.g., 3456 Pines Blvd, Pembroke Pines, FL 33024)

All data files import types from src/types/ using @/ alias. Follow the pattern established in products.ts (export const array + export helper functions).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` from project root — zero type errors. Verify all exports resolve: `node -e "console.log('types OK')"` after a successful build check.
  </verify>
  <done>
5 files exist with proper TypeScript interfaces and typed data. Story content covers Chef Anthony origin (age 11, 3 restaurants) and sauce story (92% asked to bottle). Team has 3 members. Restaurants has 3 South Florida locations with addresses.

**Create src/data/recipes.ts** with 6 Recipe objects and helper functions. All recipes MUST reference Jamaica House Brand products via `featuredProducts` array using product IDs from products.ts (RCPE-04). Include `getRecipeBySlug(slug)` and `getAllRecipes()` helpers.

The 6 recipes (diverse to showcase all 4 products):

Image paths follow pattern: /images/recipes/{slug}.jpg. Tags should include relevant food categories.

**Create src/lib/seo.ts** with `generateRecipeJsonLd(recipe: Recipe)` function:
- Import Recipe type from @/types/recipe
- Return schema.org Recipe object with @context, @type, name, description, image, prepTime (PT{N}M format), cookTime (PT{N}M), totalTime, recipeYield, recipeIngredient (array of "{amount} {item}" strings), recipeInstructions (array of HowToStep objects with @type, text, position)
- Use ISO 8601 duration format: `PT${minutes}M` — do NOT use string like "15 minutes"
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors. Verify recipe count: at least 6 recipes exported. Verify every recipe has at least one item in featuredProducts that matches a product ID from products.ts. Verify generateRecipeJsonLd returns object with @context and @type fields.
  </verify>
  <done>
recipes.ts exports 6 typed recipes, each referencing at least one product via featuredProducts. getRecipeBySlug and getAllRecipes helpers work. seo.ts generates valid schema.org Recipe JSON-LD with ISO 8601 durations (PT15M format).
