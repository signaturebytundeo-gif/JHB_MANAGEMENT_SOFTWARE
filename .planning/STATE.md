# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Production tracking is the foundation — every unit traceable from batch creation (with QC sign-off) through inventory location to sale.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Production & Quality Control

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Production & Quality Control)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-17 — Completed plan 02-01 (Production Database Foundation)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 6 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.51 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-authentication | 4 | 28m | 7m |
| 02-production-quality-control | 1 | 4m | 4m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (8m), 01-03 (7m), 01-04 (7m), 02-01 (4m)
- Trend: Improving efficiency

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Production tracking as first module - everything flows from knowing what was produced and where it is
- Build all 10 modules (full vision) - founders want complete system for investor conversations
- CSV import before API integration - pragmatic bridge to get data flowing immediately
- MMDDYY batch code format - matches existing manual workflow Anthony uses
- Founders-only initial users - Anthony and Tunde first, expand to team once workflows proven
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss - Latest version with improved performance and CSS-native theming
- Use shadcn/ui component library - Customizable, accessible, TypeScript-first components for faster development
- Use PostgreSQL adapter for Prisma v7 - Adapter pattern required for Prisma v7, provides connection pooling
- Generate Prisma client to default location - Standard @prisma/client import works seamlessly with tsx and Next.js
- Bcrypt cost factor 10 for password hashing - Good security-performance balance (~100ms per hash)
- Use jose library for JWT instead of jsonwebtoken - ESM-native, Edge runtime compatible
- Session management with 7-day sliding expiration - Encrypt/decrypt using jose HS256, httpOnly cookies
- Data Access Layer caching with React cache() - Avoid redundant session verification database queries
- Generic login error messages - Never reveal which field is wrong (prevents email enumeration)
- Role-based navigation with permission matrix - ROLE_PERMISSIONS + hasPermission + getRoleDashboard
- Use Resend for transactional emails - Industry-standard service with excellent DX and generous free tier
- Email templates use inline CSS - Email clients have inconsistent CSS support, inline styles are most reliable
- Magic link tokens single-use with 15-min expiration - Security best practice prevents token replay attacks
- Invite tokens expire after 7 days - Balances security (limited lifetime) with UX (reasonable acceptance window)
- Generic success message for magic link requests - Prevents email enumeration attacks, don't reveal registered emails
- Quick action buttons disabled with phase tooltips - Demonstrates future functionality with clear UX expectations
- Use MMDDYY format for batch codes with letter suffixes - Matches existing manual workflow Anthony uses, prevents duplicates
- Soft delete for batches (isActive flag) - Production records are immutable for audit trail and traceability
- Conditional validation via Zod refine - CO_PACKER source requires partner ID, allocations must sum to totalUnits
- SQLite Decimal without @db annotations - Prisma handles Decimal mapping automatically for SQLite
